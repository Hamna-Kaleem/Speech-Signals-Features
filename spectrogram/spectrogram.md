**Types of Spectrograms**

**Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) Spectrogram** – Standard time-frequency representation.

**Log-Scaled Spectrogram** – More interpretable for human perception.

**Mel Spectrogram** – Based on the Mel scale, which mimics human hearing.

**MFCC Spectrogram** – Compressed Mel spectrogram, commonly used in speech recognition.

**CQT (Constant-Q Transform) Spectrogram** – Good for musical applications.

**Chromagram** – Highlights pitch classes (useful in music & speech emotion detection).

🔍 **How to Interpret a Spectrogram**
A spectrogram is a 3D representation of an audio signal where:

**X-axis (Time)** → Represents time progression.

**Y-axis (Frequency)** → Shows different frequency components.

**Color Intensity (Amplitude/Power)** → Represents the energy (loudness) of each frequency at a given time.

📌 **Observing Key Features**
**Formants:** Dark horizontal bands that indicate resonant frequencies of speech sounds.

**Harmonics:** Parallel lines visible in periodic sounds like vowels.

**Silences/Gaps:** Flat regions without frequency content indicate pauses.

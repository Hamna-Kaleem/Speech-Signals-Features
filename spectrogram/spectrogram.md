What is the Fourier Transform?
Sound waves are typically represented in the time domain (waveforms), but analyzing their frequency components is crucial. The Fourier Transform (FT) converts a time-domain signal into its frequency components.

The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is commonly used in speech processing to create spectrograms, which display how frequencies change over time.

Spectrograms
A spectrogram is a visual representation of sound frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. Unlike waveforms that show amplitude over time, spectrograms reveal the frequency content.

Types of Spectrograms
Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) Spectrogram – Standard time-frequency representation.

Log-Scaled Spectrogram – More interpretable for human perception.

Mel Spectrogram – Based on the Mel scale, which mimics human hearing.

MFCC Spectrogram – Compressed Mel spectrogram, commonly used in speech recognition.

CQT (Constant-Q Transform) Spectrogram – Good for musical applications.

Chromagram – Highlights pitch classes (useful in music & speech emotion detection).

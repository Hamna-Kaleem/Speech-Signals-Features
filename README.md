Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs): Extract meaningful features for speech recognition.

**What is the Fourier Transform?**

Sound waves are typically represented in the time domain (waveforms), but analyzing their frequency components is crucial. The Fourier Transform (FT) converts a time-domain signal into its frequency components.

The **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)** is commonly used in speech processing to create spectrograms, which display how frequencies change over time.

**Spectrograms:** A spectrogram is a visual representation of sound frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. Unlike waveforms that show amplitude over time, spectrograms reveal the frequency content.

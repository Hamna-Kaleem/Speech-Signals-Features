# Speech Signal Processing - Fourier Transform, Spectrograms, and MFCCs

This repository provides an advanced-level implementation of speech signal processing, focusing on Fourier Transform, Spectrograms, and MFCCs. Additionally, it includes an interactive Streamlit app for real-time visualization of speech features.

üìå Features

Fourier Transform & Spectrograms: Convert speech signals from time-domain to frequency-domain.
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs): Extract meaningful features for speech recognition.
Streamlit App: Upload audio files and visualize waveform, spectrogram, and MFCCs.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Speech-Signal-Features.git
cd Speech-Signal-Features
pip install -r requirements.txt

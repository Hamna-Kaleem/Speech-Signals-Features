# Speech Signal Processing - Fourier Transform, Spectrograms, and MFCCs

This repository provides an advanced-level implementation of speech signal processing, focusing on Fourier Transform, Spectrograms, and MFCCs. Additionally, it includes an interactive Streamlit app for real-time visualization of speech features.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Fourier Transform & Spectrograms: Convert speech signals from time-domain to frequency-domain.

Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs): Extract meaningful features for speech recognition.

Streamlit App: Upload audio files and visualize spectrogram, and MFCCs.
